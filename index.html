                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <br>
                <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other
                    material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup 
                    are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page
                    designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical
                    report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting 
                    languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible 
                    Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by 
                    typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on 
                    elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate 
                    structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <br>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content.
                    CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer
                    questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content
                    display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I
                    decorate my webpage with background images and colors? What is CSS?
                    Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
                    language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use
                    to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
                    paragraph text, setting the color to red .CSS is designed to enable the
                    separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
                    This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] 
                    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
                    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css 
                    file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file 
                    to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

                <h1>JavaScript</h1>
                <br>
                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
                    compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
                    is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                    non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
                    CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
                    multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                    object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
                    programming) styles.JavaScript is a scripting or programming language 
                    that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time 
                    a web page does more than just sit there and display static information 
                    for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, 
                    animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that 
                    JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of 
                    standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much 
                    more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
